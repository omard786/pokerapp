need to create a <div in html in order to make it look better 
hidden tag in html adds a  token, hidden tag is connected to secret key
come back to do css so it looks nicer 
 <dir class="registrationform">
                    {{ form.username.label(class="form-control-label")}} 
makes it look nicer 

for tommorrow need to look at flask forms
need to create a update and delete feature( this can be done vvia app routes )
